"""Executor Protocols and the typed result they return.

Both `SandboxExecutor` and `TrustedExecutor` expose the same
`execute` / `resume` shape — the call signature was historically identical
between `container_pool` and `shared_worker_manager`, and we preserve that
here. The two are kept as separate Protocols so that mypy / Pyright catch
accidental misuse: a function that requires sandbox isolation cannot be
silently routed to a trusted executor (and vice versa), even though both
happen to satisfy the same call shape today.

`ExecutionResult` is the typed in-process contract between an executor impl
and `execution_engine`. The *wire* format spoken by the in-container executor
is still a JSON dict; impls translate it via `ExecutionResult.from_wire`, so
the executor image is unchanged by this refactor.

The `handle` carried on an AWAITING_INPUT result is **opaque** to the engine:
it is whatever the producing executor needs to resume (a Docker container
name today; a `namespace/pod` for the future k8s impl; a durable execution
key for a replay-based impl — see issue #79). The engine persists it and
hands it back to `resume()` unchanged.

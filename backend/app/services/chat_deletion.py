"""Hard-delete chats and the rows that hang off them.

Shared by the expired-chat cleanup and the chat retention job. The children
go first, explicitly: in a migrated database `messages`,
`pending_tool_approvals`, `pending_completions` and `executions` reference
`chats` with NO ACTION (migration 54056f649874 dropped the cascades
cd25b0f773ad had added), `tool_call_results` and workbench collections
have no foreign key at all, so a bare `DELETE FROM chats` either fails or
leaves orphans. Doing it here means neither caller depends on which
ON DELETE rules a given database ended up with. See
docs/design/chat-retention.md, "What references a chat".

"""Executor-aware data for the System page's sandbox / shared container cards.

The cards were written for the Docker executors: a warm sandbox pool and
`sinas-shared-N` containers, both discovered through the Docker socket. The
other executors either have nothing to scale (single-use containers or pods,
in-process trusted code) or keep their pods in Kubernetes. This picks the
right source per mode, and says why when there is nothing to show, instead of
reporting an empty pool.

Every result carries `executor`, `deployment`, `scalable`, `note` (what the
card is showing) and `unavailable_reason` (why it can't show anything).
